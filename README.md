# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to the daily programming puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024). Each puzzle is an exciting challenge designed to test and improve your problem-solving and coding skills.

## 📖 What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges. Starting from **December 1st**, a new problem is released every day until **December 25th**. Participants from around the world solve these problems in the programming language of their choice. It's a fun and educational way to:

- **Sharpen coding skills**  
- **Learn new techniques and algorithms**  
- **Engage in a global coding community**  
- **Celebrate the holiday season with a coding twist!**

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

Each day's solution is written in **Python** and stored in its respective directory. If you'd like to run the code for a specific day's problem, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or later** must be installed on your system.  
  [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- (Optional) Install the required dependencies using `pip`. Some days may use additional libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Running a Solution

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code-2024.git
   cd advent-of-code-2024
   ```

2. **Navigate to the day's folder:**  
   Each day’s solution is stored in a folder named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day number (e.g., `day01`, `day02`).

   ```bash
   cd day01
   ```

3. **Run the solution script:**  
   The puzzle input is usually required. Place the input file in the same directory as the script, named `puzzle_input.txt`.

   ```bash
   python day01_solution.py
   ```

   Replace `day01_solution.py` with the appropriate script for the day you wish to run.

4. **Output:**  
   The solution output will be displayed in the console.
